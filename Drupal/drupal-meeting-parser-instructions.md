This extension helps to archive the meeting log from Slack meetings for posterity. Crediting meeting participants is facilitated as well.

## How to install

1. Enable developer mode for Google Chrome Extensions.
   See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01

2. Clone this repository to any location on your local computer. Be sure you
   have added an SSH key for GitHub (for more info -
   https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
   Run this command in your terminal in your root directory
   `git clone git@github.com:mdlutz24/drupal-meeting-parser.git`

3. Use the "Load unpacked" option under Chrome Extensions to add this
   unpacked Chrome Extension to your browser. Pick the directory you checked
   this out to.

   will appear in your browser alongside
   the URL bar.
