Let’s Get ready for Drupal 9!
One goal this Contribution Day is to prepare Drupal 8 for Drupal 9. This
includes removing deprecated code within Drupal itself and third-party
dependencies. If you’re interested in helping plan the initiative or more
information on what we’re planning to check out the #d9readiness channel in the
Drupal slack.

Drupal Rector
The Rector project saves a lot of manual work by automating code upgrades from
Drupal 8 to Drupal 9. The immediate goal is to create Rector rules for the 15
most popular deprecations. Those 15 rules will cover 50% of all Drupal
deprecations! Issues are maintained on drupal.org at
https://drupal.org/project/rector.
