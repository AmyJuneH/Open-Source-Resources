# Creating an Issue

What issues are worth reporting? All of them. Creating issues is the best way
for engineers to understand how the projects are being used.

   1. Navigate to project page's issue queue and create a new issue
   2. Assign a title. The title should be brief yet succinct enough to show in
      search results.
   3. Fill in all the metadata fields:
      * Category
      * Priority
      * Status
      * Select latest branch (usually)
      * Component: this varies from project to project
      * Assign: This is typicially reserved for project maintainers. Only assign
        an issue to yourself if you intent to work on it soon.
      * Issue tags: Do not creat any new tags, this is an autocomplete field.
   4. Fill in the Issue Summary. It should include description of issue, steps
      to replicate, proposed fixes (if any), and any other relevant information.
   5. Save

If the browser extension Dreditor is installed, there is an “Insert Template”
button for the summary.
